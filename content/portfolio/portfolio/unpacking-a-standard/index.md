title: Unpacking a Standard
slug: /portfolio/unpacking-a-standard
summary: National, state, or school standards describe what students should be
  able to achieve by the end of each grade level, and teachers are expected to
  help students to meet these standards. In this video, I unpack a Grade 2
  Language Arts standard and provide some sample activities to help students
  meet the standard.
