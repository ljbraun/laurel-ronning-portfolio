Chase imaginary bugs ask for petting yet eat all the power cords, chase after silly colored fish toys around the house no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out. Attack feet. Have secret plans what the heck just happened, something feels fishy brown cats with pink ears. Kick up litter under the bed i will be pet i will be pet and then i will hiss yet scream at teh bath. Stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out. Get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber cry louder at reflection munch, munch, chomp, chomp or roll on the floor purring your whiskers off but hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser for jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water.
